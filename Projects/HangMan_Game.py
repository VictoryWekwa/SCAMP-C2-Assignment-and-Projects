""" A program that selects a random word then allows the user to guess it in a game of hangman.

Like the real game there should be blank spots for each letter in the word, and a part of the body should be
each time the user guesses a letter that is not in the answer.

You may choose how many wrong turns the user can make until the game ends.
sub-goals:
 if the user losses, print out the word at the end of the game. Create a give up option."""
